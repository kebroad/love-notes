# Cursor Rules for Love Notes Project

## Excalidraw Integration Requirements

### CRITICAL: React Version Compatibility
- **ALWAYS use React 18.x with Excalidraw** - Never use React 19+
- Excalidraw 0.18.0 dependencies (Radix UI) only support React 16-18
- React 19 causes massive peer dependency warnings and canvas rendering issues
- Use exact versions: `react@18.3.1` and `react-dom@18.3.1`
- Update TypeScript types: `@types/react@18` and `@types/react-dom@18`


## Implementation Plan Reference
- Always reference README.md implementation plan before starting development
- Follow the 5-phase approach: Backend → Frontend → Hardware → Integration → Testing
- Use the specified tech stack: React + TypeScript, Golang, Python, Firebase
